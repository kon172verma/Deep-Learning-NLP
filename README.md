# NLP-using-Deep-Learning

This repository includes many Natural Language Processing Applications, some of them are:

1. Generating Poetry:
    Using a collection of Irish Poems, we wish to train a Deep Learning model that generates similar poems.
2. Writing like Shakespeare:
    Given a collection of Shakespeare Sonnets, we wish to train a Bidirectional-LSTM model that writes texts like Shakespeare.
3. Sarcasm Detector:
    Using a labelled sarcasm dataset, we train a RNN model to detect sarcasm.
4. Sentiment Analysis:
    Using IMDB Reviews dataset, we built a model to detect if a sentence is positive or negative.
5. News Classifier:
    Given BBC News data, we built a deep learning model to classify news into various types.
